## Important Limitations & Disclaimers

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is NOT production-grade business logic**

This application serves as a demonstration and business analysis tool with several important limitations:

### üåç **Locale Handling Limitations**
- **Limited Language Support**: Currently handles only `en`, `en-US`, and `en-AU` locales
- **Hardcoded Fallbacks**: Missing comprehensive internationalization framework
- **Currency Formatting**: Basic implementation without full locale-specific formatting
- **Production Recommendation**: Implement robust i18n framework for global deployment

### ‚ö° **Performance & Scalability Concerns**
- **Product-level Promotions**: Would require Redis caching for scalable promotion lookups in high-traffic scenarios
- **Client-side Calculations**: Some business logic performed client-side for demo purposes
- **Memory Usage**: Not optimized for large catalogs or complex promotion hierarchies

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Limitations**
- **Mixed Concerns**: Business logic and presentation layer are currently combined
- **No API Abstraction**: Direct commercetools API integration without abstraction layer
- **Limited Error Handling**: Basic error scenarios covered, missing comprehensive edge case handling
- **Security Considerations**: API keys and sensitive data handling needs production hardening

## Roadmap & Next Steps

### üéØ **Planned Improvements**
1. **API Separation**
   - Extract business logic into dedicated REST APIs
   - Implement proper frontend/backend separation
   - Add comprehensive API documentation

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement Redis caching for frequent promotion lookups
   - Optimize rendering for large discount lists
